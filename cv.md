#### Code example
Coding in function ```mirrorImage```. function accept 1 parameter ```arr```, it's a number array. Your task is find the first pair of mirror-image number and return as an array. The two number must be adjacent, and the returned array is in accordance with the order from left to right.

What's the mirror-image number? for example:```123``` and ```321``` is a pair of mirror-image number. Two the same number of palindromes can also be seen as a pair of mirror-image number, such as ```121``` and ```121```. 
Some example: mirrorImage([454,86,57,75,16,88]) should return [57,75]
```
If no such number is found, return```[-1,-1]```
«function mirrorImage(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == (arr[i + 1] + '').split('').reverse().join(''))  return [arr[i],arr[i + 1]]
  }
  return [-1, -1]
}
